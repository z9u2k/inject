- simple_component
    Demonstrates how to declare a service interface and an implementation,
    register them with Inject and retrieve an implementation instance for
    the interface

    - service.h declares the interface, while service.cpp registers it with
      Inject
    - service_impl.{h,cpp} implement that interface, and register it with inject
    - context_config.cpp registers with Inject that service_impl is the
      application' provider for service; and
    - main.cpp configures the default context and requests an implementation for
      service
